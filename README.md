# PageSpace: The AI-First Workspace for Building Knowledge, Together

> üß™ **Currently in early development ‚Äî this is a scaffold, not a finished product.**  
> PageSpace is a local-first, AI-native workspace where you compose, remix, and automate your team‚Äôs thinking. This project is available for personal and testing use.

---

PageSpace is your modular workspace for working with context ‚Äî not just information.  
Instead of stitching together Slack for messaging, Notion for notes, and Google Drive for files, PageSpace gives you one AI-powered environment where **you, your team, and your tools all collaborate on the same canvas**.

Built for those who treat **work as creative structure**, not scattered files ‚Äî and who believe that **AI should enhance, not obscure, your process**.

**Our philosophy is simple:** your work should be a memory you can shape, navigate, and reuse ‚Äî not a silo you forget.

## üß± Core Model: A Composable Workspace for Thinking in Context

PageSpace isn‚Äôt just a knowledge base ‚Äî it‚Äôs a structured thinking environment, where **documents, conversations, and AI share the same shape**.

We believe:

- üß† **Context is the creative layer.** Meaning emerges from structure. A note in a folder is different than a note alone ‚Äî and PageSpace treats that as real data.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Structure encodes logic.** Move a page, change the meaning. Our AI respects hierarchy, tags, and position ‚Äî and answers differently based on what‚Äôs near what.
- üìÑ **Everything is a Page.** Docs, chats, spreadsheets, task lists, AIs ‚Äî all nestable, linked, and permissioned. You don‚Äôt move between tools; the tools move with you.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ Agentic, Context-Aware AI
- **Human-in-the-Loop Agentic Edits:** AI suggests changes to your documents, which you can review, approve, and apply with a single click. A fuzzy-search algorithm ensures suggestions are applied correctly even if the text has moved.
- **Page AI:** An AI that lives *inside* your documents, scoped by position, permissions, and tags.
- **Assistant AI:** A workspace-wide AI for discovery, synthesis, and search across all your content.
- **Multi-Page Thinking:** Ask questions that span multiple documents, with traceable sources for every claim.

### üìù Advanced, Composable Editor
- **Synchronized Rich Text & Code:** A seamless editor experience with Tiptap for rich text and Monaco for raw HTML, always kept in sync.
- **AI-Ready Formatting:** Content is automatically formatted using Prettier, ensuring clean, human-readable HTML that is perfect for line-based diffing and AI manipulation.
- **Vibe Pages:** Create interactive, sandboxed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets‚Äîideal for prototyping components or creating live examples.

### üóÇÔ∏è Nestable Workspace Graph
- **Pages-as-Primitives:** Every object is a page‚Äîdocuments, folders, chats, lists, or AIs.
- **Recursive Composition:** Nest a spreadsheet inside a note, inside a folder, with an embedded AI.
- **Smart Mentions:** Link anything to anything. Mention pages, filter views, or create semantic maps.

### üîê Local-First, AI-Native
- **Fully Containerized:** One `docker-compose up` for a local-first instance with real AI capabilities.
- **Secure by Design:** RBAC, permission inheritance, and air-gapped deploys.
- **Hackable Core:** Built in Next.js 15, Drizzle ORM, pgvector, and Socket.IO‚Äîno mystery meat.

## üöÄ Get Started in 5 Minutes

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (v20+), pnpm, Docker

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/2witstudios/pagespace.team.git
    cd pagespace.team
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root and `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env`. Generate a secure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for the root `.env` file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
    # Generate a strong ENCRYPTION_KEY for .env (e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 32`)
    ```
4.  **Launch the environment:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

Your pagespace instance is now running:
- **Web App:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Realtime Server:** `http://localhost:3001`

## Project Status

This project is currently in its **foundation phase** ‚Äî a minimal but extensible scaffold designed to support powerful knowledge tools. The core architecture is now in place, including:

- A hierarchical page system and layout framework
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and permission tree
- Context-aware AI chat as a base interaction layer

From here, upcoming functionality will be built **directly on top of this foundation**:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** ‚Äî including lexical and vector search ‚Äî will respect the existing permission model to deliver secure, scoped results.
- **AI Artifacts and Snippets** will expand the AI layer with persistent, reusable outputs tied to documents, tags, and users.
- **Any File Type Uploads** will add convenience and depth to the system by enabling automatic parsing, embedding, and intelligent display of diverse content formats like PDFs, spreadsheets, emails, and images.

We‚Äôre optimizing for long-term adaptability rather than short-term feature completeness. This phase is about getting the scaffolding right so future capabilities fit naturally into place.

## üó∫Ô∏è Visual Roadmap: Where We're Going

We believe in building in public. Our roadmap is not just a list of features ‚Äî it's a reflection of our priorities and philosophy.
