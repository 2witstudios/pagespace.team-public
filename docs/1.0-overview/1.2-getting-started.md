# Getting Started

Welcome to PageSpace! This guide will walk you through setting up your local development environment. PageSpace is a local-first, collaborative knowledge management tool designed for privacy and extensibility.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v20.x or later.
- **pnpm**: If you don't have pnpm, you can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`.
- **Docker**: Required for running the PostgreSQL database. [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd pagespace.team
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    This project uses two separate `.env` files for configuration. You'll need to create them from the provided examples:

    - **Root `.env`**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root.
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
      This file contains the `DATABASE_URL` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. The `DATABASE_URL` is used for database migrations, and the default is suitable for the local Docker setup. You will need to generate a secure `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

    - **Web App `.env`**: Copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env`.
      ```bash
      cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
      ```
      This file contains the public socket URL.

4.  **Start the development environment:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    You should see output indicating that the `postgres`, `web`, and `realtime` services have started successfully.

## Accessing the Application

Once the services are running, you can access the application:

- **Web Application**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Realtime Server**: `http://localhost:3001`

## Next Steps

Now that your environment is running, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to sign up and create your first drive.
