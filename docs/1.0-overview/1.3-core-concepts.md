# Core Concepts

This document outlines the foundational ideas that underpin the PageSpace platform. These principles are not just design decisions—they are convictions that shape every data model, API, and UI pattern across the system.

### 1. Context Is Memory

We treat memory as structured context, not a flat list. Every thought, message, or document only makes sense where it lives. A chat in a folder, a document inside a project, an AI inside a note—meaning comes from placement. In PageSpace, memory is always tree-structured, position-aware, and recursively traversable.

**Implication:** Pages, chats, and AI all inherit context from their location in the tree.

### 2. Structure Encodes Meaning

Folders aren’t just containers—they’re semantics. A page moved to a new parent means something new. Like grammar in language, placement changes meaning. That’s why we treat hierarchy as a core semantic layer: it drives permissions, relevance, and AI behavior.

**Implication:** The UI, routing, and permission system all operate on this spatial-semantic model.

### 3. Pages Are the Universal Primitive

Everything in PageSpace is a page: documents, folders, chats, databases, AI. This allows recursive, nestable composition. A document can contain a database, which contains a chat, which includes an AI.

**Implication:** The entire system is powered by a single, recursive content model.

---

### 4. Permission and AI Inherit Context

Permissions flow downward. AI context flows upward. If you can see a page, you can see its children. If you’re chatting with an AI inside a page, that AI understands the context of its parents.

**Implication:** Access and intelligence are spatially coherent by default.

---

### 5. Tags Are Orthogonal Context

While hierarchy encodes structure, tags encode cross-cutting context—status, priority, or type. Pages can be flexibly grouped, filtered, or surfaced across the tree using tags.

**Implication:** Tagging is additive metadata; it never overrides structural meaning.

---

### 6. Recursive UI Mirrors the Data Model

The frontend is not a set of disjoint apps—it’s a recursive viewer of a recursive model. The same tree powers documents, chats, permissions, and AI context windows.

**Implication:** One data model powers every interface, making the system both extensible and predictable.
