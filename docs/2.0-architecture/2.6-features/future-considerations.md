# Future Architecture Considerations

### Extensibility Points
- **Message parts system** - Ready for artifacts, snippets, interactive content
- **Mention system** - Supports new entity types (projects, tags, etc.)
- **Rich text components** - Work across documents, forms, comments
- **Permission system** - Scales to complex organizational hierarchies

### Search Architecture
A robust search implementation is critical to delivering on the promise of an institutional search engine. Our approach will be multi-modal, combining several techniques to provide the most relevant results for different user intents.

- **Hybrid Lexical & Vector Search:** We will implement a hybrid search model that combines the strengths of traditional keyword-based (lexical) search with modern semantic (vector) search.
  - **Lexical Search:** Ideal for finding specific terms, names, or phrases. We will use PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities for this.
  - **Vector Search:** Ideal for finding conceptually similar documents, even if they don't share keywords. We will use `pgvector` for this, with embeddings generated by local Ollama models.

- **Parallel Queries:** To ensure fast results, the search API will execute lexical and vector queries in parallel. The results will then be combined and re-ranked before being returned to the user.

- **Summary Mapping:** For long documents, we will generate and store summaries of the content. This will allow the search engine to quickly identify relevant documents without having to scan the entire text. These summaries will also be used to provide context-rich snippets in the search results.

- **Search Modes:** The UI will support different search modes to cater to different user needs:
  - **"Quick Find":** A fast, general-purpose search that balances speed and relevance.
  - **"Deep Dive":** A more thorough search that may take longer but will return more comprehensive results.
  - **"Precedent Search":** A specialized search mode for finding similar documents, contracts, or proposals.

### Planned Enhancements
- FastAPI microservice for document automation workflows
- Enhanced collaboration features with real-time sync
- Advanced AI model integration options
- Enterprise compliance and audit features
